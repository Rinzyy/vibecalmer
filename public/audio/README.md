# Audio Files for Meditation Timer

This directory contains audio files used by the meditation timer:

- `bell.mp3`: A bell sound played at the start and end of meditation
- `hrv.mp3`: Heart Rate Variability (HRV) sound for focused breathing
- `ambient.mp3`: Ambient background sound for relaxation

You can replace these files with your own audio files as long as you keep the same filenames.
